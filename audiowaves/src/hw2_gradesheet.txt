2 PROGRESS POSTS [ ?? / 5 ] 
Posted on LMS on the dates specified on the calendar.  Includes short
description of status, and at least one image.  Reasonable progress
has been made.


SPRING FORCE COMPUTATION & VISUALIZATION [ ?? / 1 ]
structural, sheer, & bend/flexion springs and gravity
  ./simulation -cloth small_cloth.txt -timestep 0.001


ANIMATION USING NUMERICAL INTEGRATION [ ?? / 2 ]
simulation matches the provot over-stretched cloth example
  ./simulation -cloth provot_original.txt -timestep 0.001


ALTERNATE INTEGRATION SCHEMES [ ?? ]
1 pt extra credit for trapezoid or midpoint integration 
2 pts extra credit for runge-kutta integration
2 pts extra credit for an implicit scheme


INTERATIVE OVER-STRETCHED SPRING ADJUSTMENT [ ?? / 2 ]
For both the structural & sheer springs.  Matches Provot results.

NEW CLOTH TEST SCENE [ ?? / 1 ]
1 pt for required new scene.  1 additional point pt (extra credit) for
a complex scene requiring changes to the scene parsing, etc.


COLLISION DETECTION [ ?? ]
1-3 points extra credit for implementation of cloth collision detection


CORRECT VELOCITY INTERPOLATION IN xy PLANE  [ ?? / 3 ]
  ./simulation -fluid fluid_random_xy.txt -timestep 0.01


CORRECT VELOCITY INTERPOLATION IN yz && xz PLANES  [ ?? ]
2 points extra credit if it works correctly in 3D

  ./simulation -fluid fluid_dam.txt -timestep 0.01


PLAUSIBLE RESULTS GENERATED FOR DROP & DAM EXAMPLES [ ?? ]
1-2 points extra credit for a working fluid simulation
(it's ok if these examples blow up after a short time)
